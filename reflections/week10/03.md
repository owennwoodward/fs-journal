## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Information in a row is the entire object. Then the information in a column is everything about that object. Whether it be the price, name, type, any thing related to the object. 

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id. 

You will first do CREATE TABLE characters(
    id int NOT NULL,
    name string NOT NULL,
    age int,
    description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
)

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name; Delete from removes the entire row you just created


DROP TABLE table_name;

Dropping a table will delete everything from a table but you will not be able to retrieve the data. 

```
