## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An Enum are unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to an integral value. It is also strongly typed. This means it can't be implicitly assigned to an enum.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can ALTER MODIFY an enum which will add a new value. You can also MODIFY COLUMN OR ALTER TABLE.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have not used an Enums yet. If I were going to use them I would probably put them in a category type enum, such as like a type of event. "Concerts", "Restaurants", "Sports" or something of that sort.
