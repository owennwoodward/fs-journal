## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

There is a value type that holds numbers. There is a Passing Reference Type, which when passed between one method to another it doesn't create a new copy. Then there is a pointer type which don't inherit from objects and there are no conversions.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript? 

It's a value type where when on method passes to another it creates a separate copy from the variable into another method. I'd say the the differences I noticed from JS is that you have to pass value types in different methods.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

I think this means that your data is stored in lets say in a bank. When you go to access your data you don't have any idea where its at. The reference type is like a letter you would get which would tell you how to get to the bank and retrieve your data. This is different from a value type because it's stored in two different places when it's passed from one method to another.
