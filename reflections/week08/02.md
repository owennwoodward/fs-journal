## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Communication in a small team is just as important as a large team because you are tackling larger issues with less people. So you will need to communicate to let everybody know what you are doing and how long it will take.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Some adjustments to be made are the communication methods. Rather than having multiple meetings, its better to have shorter more effective methods such as slack or anything instant message based.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

It's the paradox between speed of developing versus the quality of the product you are creating. The tradeoffs are getting a MVP versus something that is considered 'Ideal features.'
