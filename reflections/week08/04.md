## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

There is unit testing which allows you to test individual units of code, component testing which allows you to test your components and see if they're actually mounted to the DOM, and end-to-end testing which tests to see if your app is actually live and working for others.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Realistically I think the most effective is the component side. Without any of your components working you can't actually deploy your application.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I think the least useful would probably be unit testing. Although it's very useful, I think if you component test you could eventually iron out any errors that unit testing would find
