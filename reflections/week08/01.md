## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide? 

It shows what you are experienced in and your skill level

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

It can be made effective with showcasing how you tackle problems, especially if you make a readme to document how you went about tackling these problems

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I think I would like to show off my capstone, although it isn't all my work directly I think it's a great piece because we had extra time put into it. It also showcases that I can work in groups since I would assume that's most of the developing work.
