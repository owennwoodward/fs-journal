## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

It allows you to wait for a function to be called, rather than be ran right away. It will also run lines of code synchronously

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

You have to use Async before you can ever await anything.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

Code is much easier to read due to promises and chaining. You can follow the lines of code and when and where they execute.
