## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

The three states are pending - resolved - or rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Rather than callbacks always being ran, if we use promises the call back won't run every time. Rather just the promise or the catch

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

using then is for when a promise is kept and executed. Catch will be used to catch the error if the promise isnt kept
