## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using mapbox, yelp api, and a few others spread about

2. What went well so far?

Mostly everything has went well. We have hit a wall a few times due to conflicting ideas and methods of coding but have always found a middle ground.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I think a different approach would be to take more breaks, do a little more research into documentation.
