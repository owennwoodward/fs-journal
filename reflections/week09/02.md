## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

A GitHub action is something that when your repo changes it will run a command to do something. Such as compress an image, test your code, push to a site etc. 

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

These options provide total automation if you want it to be that way. It can just ease the burden of having to do everything manually yourself and let GitHub take some of the workload if not all of it.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

You can use either rules, a timer, or even an API. These triggers are what define the workflow and how it's going to be controlled. So if it's a timer it will start a certain time and then the workflow will do its due diligence.
