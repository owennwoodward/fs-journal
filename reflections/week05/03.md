## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

It's a more complex term for time management. 

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Definitely apply the two minute rule. I've always loved the idea if you can send it in an email, it doesnt need to be a meeting.

Strategically quitting is a great idea, especially if you have a never give up mentality. 

The golden hour is also very accurate, i think everybody has certain time frame where they work the best and mine is probably about 1-4 P.M

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

I think a good example of me benefitting from timeboxing would be doing checkpoints. I would knock my checkpoints out much faster when I work
during my golden hour.
