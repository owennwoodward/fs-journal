## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement? 
I implements pair programming in the first two days. Paired programming is one of my favorite things to do in class. I feel like I truly
learn quite a bit having another person watch you code. It kind of puts you in the spot like a whiteboard challenge.

2. What went well this week?

Not a whole lot. I think I really have the understanding of full stack, I just need to keep coding to really get the hang of doing both.

3. What would you do differently?

I would ask for help sooner. I felt like I Struggled on little things for so long. If I would have asked I could have most likely finished 
my checkpoint during the weekdays.
