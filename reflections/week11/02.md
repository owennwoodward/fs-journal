## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

Primary keys are unique pieces of information and it is how you identify records on a table through SQL. Where as foreign keys are 
are keys that are used to reference data from another table. It essentially tells you where it has to look to pull specific data. 

2. What is an `Alias`?

An alias is a term that can be used to shortcut long methods. You can create an alternate shorter name rather than having to type an entire term out such as like DogsService to _ds

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:



```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

            SELECT
            d.*,
            p.*
            FROM patients p
            JOIN doctors d ON d.id = d.creatorId";
