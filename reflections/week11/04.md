## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This course was extremely great and I'm glad i went through it. There was never a time where I felt like I couldn't get help or I was too lost to continue. I would have never been able to get this kind of knowledge on my own or online. It was also amazing that I as able to use my VA benefits and not have any trouble with it. It was a quick and easy process and didn't put any extra stress on me, as if this course wasn't stressful enough. All in all my experience was great and I'd recommend anybody to come through it. 

My only concerns so far is getting a job. I know it's not the hardest thing but I think that first job is going to be the only time I struggle or stress to find something. As soon as I get past that stage of employment I think it will be steady sailing from here on out. I'm really banking on either trying to go to In time Tec or Allata. I've heard great things about them and they know the skills we have here at Codeworks and have a program just for us which is relieving. 

I plan to manage my time well, considering as soon as I finish the final I'm applying to every entry level job there is. I'll stay on top of coding by finding some other assignments online or going back to some old ones like towers. Hopefully the job search isn't too long as I can't wait to see what commercial developing looks like.

I enjoyed pretty much everything about the course. I was definitely nervous coming in because I had no idea what to expect. I knew it would be hard but I had no idea I'd make friends with pretty much everybody. It was seriously on of the best few months I've had in awhile. I'm genuinely sad the course is done but happy to begin a career that I'm passionate about. The course was very hard at times and I had my moments of almost pulling my hair out but I'm happy I made it through.
