## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows us to describe relationships between two different models or classes. 

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

A class does inherit everything from the base class when you use a colon. This could be done with Profile : Account. Profile will inherit everything from account.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Some of the inheritance isn't always passed down. Constructors can't be passed down and are not inheritable when using c#. Every class must declare its own Constructors.
