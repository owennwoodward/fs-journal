## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? It can help with architecture and design purposes.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
They are low to high. Low being minimal detail and high being final product worthy. 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
I think its opinionated but I would say they are worth the effort. It can really lay out the vision and help you
brainstorm and or not have to take more time to think and hopefully come up with something that works.
